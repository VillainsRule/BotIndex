The functionality is also unknown, and there are almost no mentions or recollections of this bot being in chat across old members.

The account has almost no known evidence of existance inside the Blacket server, only containing a few screenshots and one /user command.

After hours of arguments and threats, Death finally paid an unnamed mod to ban the bot for 6 weeks, angering Loli. After attempting to accuse Death of posting disgusting content, Death bribed another mod to ban Loli Overlord permanently from the server. The account "Loli Overlord" no longer exists on Discord, however the Blacket account Loli was logged into last in December 2023, which means it's hard to gague if they actually stayed away from the game.`}};return e.jsxs(e.Fragment,{children:[e.jsx("div",{className:a.background,children:e.jsx("div",{className:a.backgroundImage})}),e.jsxs("div",{className:a.main,children:[e.jsx("div",{className:a.title,children:"Blacket Bot Index"}),e.jsx("div",{className:a.subtitle,children:"built by Death! ðŸª„"}),e.jsx("ul",{className:a.botList,children:Object.entries(o).map(i=>e.jsxs(e.Fragment,{children:[e.jsx("li",{className:a.botName,children:i[0]}),e.jsx("ul",{children:Object.entries(i[1]).map(r=>e.jsxs("li",{className:a.botFact,children:[r[0],": ",r[1]]}))})]}))})]})]})}l(document.getElementById("root")).render(e.jsx(d,{children:e.jsx(u,{children:e.jsx(f,{path:"/",element:e.jsx(v,{})})})}));export{x as g};
