After requesting verified bot, it was used for around two hours before going inactive permanently. The account has almost no known evidence of existance inside the Blacket server, only containing a few screenshots and one /user command. Most evidence is in Death\'s DMs with fristic, which he refuses to reveal. At some point, this bot was deleted by Xotic.'

            'Story': 'This bot was created by a user named "Loli Overlord", who built it in of all things Python. After using Replit bot hosting to keep it up 24/7, it became a competitor to Confidence. After hours of arguments and threats, Death finally paid an unnamed mod to ban the bot for 6 weeks, angering Loli. After attempting to accuse Death of posting disgusting content, Death bribed another mod to ban Loli Overlord permanently from the server. The account "Loli Overlord" no longer exists on Discord, however the Blacket account Loli was logged into last in December 2023, which means it\'s hard to gague if they actually stayed away from the game.'
